; XEOS first stage bootloader
; 
; The binary form of this file must no be larger than 512 bytes (one sector).
; The last two bytes have to be the standard PC boot signature (0xAA55).
; 
; Note about compiling:
;
; This file has to be compiled as a flat-form binary file.
; 
; The following compilers have been successfully tested:
; 
;       - NASM - The Netwide Assembler
;       - YASM - The Yasm Modular Assembler
; 
; Other compilers have not been tested.
; 
; Examples:
; 
;       - nasm -f bin -o [boot.flp] [boot.asm]
;       - yasm -f bin -o [boot.flp] [boot.asm]
; 
; It can then be copied to a floppy disk image (as it contains a valid MBR):
; 
;       - dd -conv=notrunc if=[bin] of=[floppy]
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; We are in 16 bits mode
BITS    16

; We are in 16 bits real mode
%ifndef $XEOS.cpu.realMode    
%define $XEOS.cpu.realMode 1
%endif

; Includes the FAT-12 MBR, so the beginning of the binary will be a valid
; FAT-12 floppy drive
%include "XEOS.mbr.fat12.inc.16.asm"

; First stage bootloader
; 
; This section is the bootloader's code that will be runned by the BIOS.
; 
; At this time, the memory layout is the following:
; 
;       - 0x0000 - 0x003F:  ISR vectors addresses (Interrupt Service Routine)
;       - 0x0040 - 0x004F:  BIOS data
;       - 0x0050 - 0x07BF:  Free
;       - 0x07C0 - 0x07DF:  Bootloader
;       - 0x07CE - 0x9FFF:  Free
;       - 0xA000 - 0xBFFF:  BIOS video sub-system
;       - 0xC000 - 0xEFFF:  BIOS ROM
;       - 0xF000 - 0xFFFF:  System ROM
; 
; Note that those addresses uses the segment:offset addressing mode:
; 
;   base address = base address * segment size (16) + offset
; 
; So 0x07C0 is 0x07C0:0 which is 0x07C00.
